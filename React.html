What is React? What is the Role of React in software development? V.Im
  * React is an open source Javascript Library for building User Interfaces
  * It has rich ecosystem, Greate community support, easy to use with other libraries and moduels
  * React simplifies the creation of complex UI and SPA by using reasable components

Key futures
  * Virutal Dom 
  * Component Based Architecture
  * Reusability
  * JSX
  * Community & Ecosystem 
  * React Hooks

What is Dome? What is the difference between HTML and DOM
  Dom stands for document object model
  Dom is a top part of dom tree representation
  we can manuplate dome to make changes in html

Dom vs virtual dom
  The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM
  can manipulate much faster than the real DOM.
  when we are making changes in real Dom for every single changes It will take more time 
  Bue when we are making changes in virtual DOM it collects all changes and update real Dom

Components? What are the main elements of it?
 These are Javascript  Functions or Classes returning some JSX value 
 JSX is looks like html but we can perform some js operation with it
  
SAP ?
 without reloading the page update the data of web page and switching one page to another page that is called SAP

 
React advantage and disadvantage 
  adv: 
  simple to build single page application
  react is cross plantform and open source
  Light weight and very Fast because of virtual dom
  Large community and ecosystem
  easy testing

  disadvantage:
  we need to depend on other library still we are installing what we want only so it’s not a big problem
  not very good choise for static very small websites (webswites not going to update component reuse component)

Jsx? 
  JavaScript XML
  JSX is looks like html but we can perform some js operation with it
  className instead of class and  htmlFor instead of for
  with the help of bable library we are converting this to js
  It’s maket he process simpler for developers
